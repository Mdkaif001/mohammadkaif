  about: `
Hello, World! I’m Mohammad Kaif — a curious problem solver and passionate Full Stack Developer who loves turning ideas into impactful software. I believe great technology should not just work, but feel simple, intuitive, and human.

With 1+ years of experience, I specialize in building user-centric web and mobile applications using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and modern front-end technologies. Beyond my professional work, I enjoy experimenting with new tools and frameworks, always learning, and creating side projects that push my boundaries.

One of my proudest projects, [HIREREADY AI](https://ai-interview-frontend-zeta.vercel.app/), is an AI-powered interview preparation tool designed especially for beginners. It helps learners practice interviews in a safe environment with dynamic questions, real-time feedback, and a smooth user experience — giving them the confidence to shine when it matters most.

Outside of coding, you’ll often find me exploring new tech trends, collaborating with peers, or brainstorming ideas that could make someone’s life a little easier. I’m always excited to connect with people who share the same energy for building and learning.

Let’s connect and build something meaningful together!
